# Predicting-the-cost-of-health-insurance

Health insurance cost prediction involves using statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms in the R programming language to analyze historical health insurance data and make predictions about future health insurance costs. This can help insurers and healthcare providers better anticipate and manage costs, and can also help consumers make more informed decisions about their coverage options.
